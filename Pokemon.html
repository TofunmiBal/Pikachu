                  Pokémon, also known as Pocket Monsters in Japan, is a media franchise managed
                  by The Pokémon Company, a Japanese consortium between Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. 
                  The franchise copyright is shared by all three companies, but Nintendo is the sole owner of the trademark.
                  Pokémon, also known as Pokémon the Series, is an anime television series based on the Pokémon video game series.

                  What are Pokémon games?Satoshi Tajiri first developed the Pokémon concept back in 1989, having collected insects as a child.
                  Inspired by the wide and vibrant world of insects, Tajiri wanted to develop a game through which players could catch
                  and catalog intriguing animal species out in the wild.
                  The original Pokémon games are Japanese role-playing video games (RPGs) with an element of strategy,
                  and were created by Satoshi Tajiri for the Game Boy.            
                  <h1/>
                  <h1>
                   Pokémon largely revolves around the idea of ‘catching’ monsters through throwing spheres, 
                   known as ‘Pokeballs’. The game series has come under criticism over the years through organizations
                   such as PETA, which claim that it glorifies animal abuse. 
                   However, Nintendo  as a family-friendly company has continued to assert the opposite. In the games, animals willingly
                   participate  and they simply "pass out" during battle.

                   The Pokémon phenomenon has expanded to a jaw-dropping extent. It’s more than just a series of games 
                    it’s a card game, a long-running anime, and you can find just about anything with Pokémon branded on it
                   Pokémon Sword and Shield, the two latest installments in the series, were released in November 2019. These were the first ‘main’ 
                    Pokémon adventures – not spin-offs – to be released on a home console. Namely, they are playable for the Nintendo Switch.
                    Pokémon trading cards are hugely collectible and often valuable. Old first edition cards in perfect condition can sell for as much as$40. 
                    Holographic cards, however, in good to perfect condition sell for between $1,000 and $24,000!
                    There has, in fact, been a rise in forgeries surrounding Pokémon paraphernalia and cards.
                    Therefore, if you do have a shiny Charizard in the back of your cupboard, make sure it’s legitimate before you try selling it!
                  <h1/>
                  <h1>
                    Nintendo officially owns the rights to the Pokémon brand; however,
                    Game Freak and The Pokémon Company are also involved in the games’ production.
                    For a short period, during the initial burst of popularity in the mobile game Pokémon Go,
                    Nintendo’s share price spiked. However, once Nintendo confirmed they had nothing to do with the title, their share price dipped again!
                    Pikachu is inarguably the most iconic Pokémon. Its name literally translates as ‘electric mouse’ – a pretty apt description. 
                    Pikachu is such an icon that it’s split off into a number of spinoff games and has been a staple
                    character in the Super Smash Bros series of games since the early 00s.

                  In 1998, Joan Wagnon, a Kansas mayor, renamed her town of ‘Topeka’ 
                  to ‘Topikachu’ to coincide with a national Pokémon event – endorsed by Nintendo, of course!
                  It’s estimated that Pokémon has helped Nintendo gross more than $90 billion worldwide. This,
                  it’s thought, makes it the most profitable entertainment franchise of all time.
                  Pokémon Go remains hugely popular, and during the COVID-19 lockdown, the game was adapted to allow people to catch creatures at home.
                  This is a big difference from the game which normally requires you to go walking out and about in public!
                  <h1/>

                   As of 2020, there have been 23 animated Pokémon movies, but only one live-acton film. This movie, Detective Pikachu,
                   was released in 2019, and features Deadpool’s The Pokémon anime, which focuses on the never-ending journey of trainer Ash Ketchum,
                   is itself a long runner. It’s been continuing to roll episodes out since 1997, across 24 seasons.
                   What’s notable is that Ash’s main Pokémon – a Pikachu – has never evolved. Evolution 
                   of Pokémon is a big part of the games – which has led viewers to wonder if the same will ever happen to Ash’s Pikachu!
                   Ryan Reynolds as the voice of Pikachu. It’s a combination that surprisingly works wonders! 
                   Other stars originally thought to be in line for the role of Pikachu included Dwayne Johnson and Hugh Jackman.
                   Rhydon, a rhino-like Pokémon, was the first-ever monster designed for the games.
